## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

I think I already understand how to utilize flexbox and CSS grid, and I want to learn more about the additional things they can be used for. However, I'm still having trouble understanding how to use the CSS properties of min-width and min-height to create responsive websites and I want to focus on that.
